  <p>This recipe for chocolate chip cookies is simply <em>amazing</em>. This recipe does not take too long to make, only requires ingredients you would
  have at home, and is an amazing treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. These cookie are perfect for any situation. Mother's day, a birthday, or even a wedding. And if these don't get you laid, you really have no hope in life.</p>
  
  <p>These cookies turn out perfect every time. My 3 year old cousin could make these with her eyes closed and one arm around her teddy bear. That might be a little big of an exaggeration. But the chocolate is perfectly paired with the light and delicous taste of the dough. These cookies crispy, <em>but</em> also chewy. Doughy <em>yet</em> perfectly baked. Buttery <em>and also</em> sweet. You tell me, what more could you want from chocolate chip cookies.</p>
