This meal is perfect for when you are not in the mood for your normal bland food, but instead want to spice things up a little. This fried rice also only takes <em>20 minutes </em>to make!!</p>

  <p>So I know you're now wondering how to make this fried rice we have been talking about. So let's get right into it</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons Sesame oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound medium-large fresh shrimp, cleaned</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen peas and diced carrots blend</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Frozen corn</li>
    <li>2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced or pressed</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
    <li>2 to 3 green onions, trimmed and sliced into thin rounds</li>
    <li>3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, shrimp, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. Cooking time will vary based on size of shrimp, don't overcook. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices to remain in skillet) and place shrimp on a plate; set aside.</li>
    <li>Add the peas, carrots, corn, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.</li>
    <li>Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.</li>
    <li>Add the shrimp, rice, green onions, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, evenly season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until shrimp is reheated through. Recipe is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently as desired.</li>
